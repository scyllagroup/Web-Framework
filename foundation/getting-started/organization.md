# Organization

## Where to Find Things

The Web Framework has a specific file and folder structure. The table below summarizes what each folder holds and references specific files you should be familiar with. 

<p class="tip">
For more information about how the front-end code works please read the [Guidelines for CSS](GuidelinesForCSS) and [Guidelines for JS](GuidelinesForJS).
</p>

<p class="danger">
Some files are hidden from view in Visual Studio Code. These files are rarely edited â€“ hiding them reduces some of the clutter in the tree view, and makes the project much easier to navigate. If for any reason you may need to edit a hidden file, you can toggle it's display value in the workspace settings file. You can also use the search feature to find a specific file.
