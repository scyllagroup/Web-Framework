# Navigation

## Highlights

*   Multiple navigation systems are supported: standard, sub-menu, dropdown, and mega-dropdown.
*   Menus displayed on navigation item hover have a timeout when user cursor transition between navigation items occurs. The timeout will be reset if the cursor returns     to the original revealed menu. This prevents instantly showing and hiding menus on accidnetal cursor movements.
*   By default, the navigation has a hamburger menu on that will slide navigation menus in and out of view on small and extra small displays.

## Roadmap

*   Hamburger menu for alternative display.
*   Kabob shown for additional items not in view.
*   Define some basic styling for navigation. Use or update provided colors from framework.
*   Animation
*   Design and implement solution for when menu items do not fit on the screen (kabob).
*   Design and implement mobile solutions and options.
*   Enhanced navigation to include minor delay, allow first click to reveal menu, and similar features that improve UX.

TBD.
