# Sticky Elements

## Highlights

_Sticky Elements are under development and will most likely be renamed. An ES6 class named OnScroll has been started to "pin" an element - similar to what Scroll Magic does._

## Roadmap

*   The overall goal is to build a more performant and standards compliant Scroll Magic library.
*   Use a mix of requestAnimationFrame and CSS styles to provide high performant transitions, animations, and customization of elements on the page during scroll events.
*   Map data attributes to options / properties.
