* Conventions in the framework help the entire team follow best practices in web development.
* Established strategies for regression, unit, and browser testing.

### Dependencies

* An optional dependency is **Yarn** which should be installed globally.
* The build system makes use of: **Babel**, **WebPack**, and **BrowserSync**.
* The testing strategy makes use of: **Mocha**, and **Selenium** (with support for **BrowserStack**).
* There is an ever-growing list of development and production dependencies. Notable mentions: **PostCSS**, **ESLint**, and **Imagemin**.
