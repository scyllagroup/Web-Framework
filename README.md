<h1>Web Framework</h1>
<p>v1.0.0</p>
</div>

## Introduction

The Scylla Web Framework serves as the foundation for our web-based projects and applications. 

The framework consists of a set of precomposed, commonly-used, front-end **user interface** elements and components, **conventions** that encourage knowledge-sharing across team members and ensure we implement best practices for developing on the web across large teams, and lastly we have an agnostic **build system** enabling: design-in-browser, testing, and output of production-ready assets.

### Highlights

* Rapidly wireframe, concept, and prototype websites.
* Easy onboarding or transition for graphic designer roles to begin proofing their work in browser.
* Encourages knowledge sharing across team members with varying amounts of experience, such as junior and senior levels, or team members with varying roles and disciplines such as graphic designers, front-end developers, and back-end developers.
* Conventions in the framework help the entire team follow best practices in web development.
* Testability 

### Dependencies

* To start, you should have both **Git** and **NodeJS** installed.
* The build system makes use of: **Babel**, **WebPack**, and **BrowserSync**.
* The testing strategy makes use of: **Mocha**, and **Selenium** (with support for **Browser Stack**).
* Other notable projects include **PostCSS**, **ESLint**, and **Imagemin**.

## Getting Started

If this is your first time getting started with the framework you should follow the instructions in [Setup and Configuration](/foundation/getting-started/setup-and-configuration). If you are using the framework for the purpose of wireframing and prototyping and this is your first time, read over [Designing with the Framework](/foundation/for-designers/design-with-the-framework). If you are contributing to the framework, squashing bugs, or developing new components of your own [Developing with the Framework](developing-with-the-framework) is where you'll want to start.
