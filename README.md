<h1>Web Framework</h1>
<p>v1.0.0</p>
</div>

## Getting Started

Our web framework serves as the foundation for our web-based projects and applications. It's composed of non-intrusive CSS resets, styled elements, and javascript components built with responsiveness and progressive enhancement in mind. You can choose to use the entire framework, or strip only the parts you need.

Some highlights:

* Front-end code is written in **HTML**, **SCSS** (for CSS), and **ES6** (for JavaScript).
* The following technologies are used in the build stack: **Node**, **Babel**, and **WebPack**.
* The following are used for testing: **Browsersync**, **Mocha**, and **Selenium** with support for **Browser Stack**.
* Our Web Framework makes no assumptions about the back-end, thus it will work in any environment or technology-stack.
* Since we are primarily focused on delivering **ASP.NET MVC** solutions, like **Umbraco**-powered web sites, the Web Framework is not entirely free from influence.
* **Visual Studio Code** is the IDE of choice. The project even contains settings to speed along the setup of the project in this IDE. But you are more than welcome to use any editor you are comfortable with.

## What Next?

If this is your first time getting started with the framework you should follow the instructions in [Setup and Configuration](/setup-and-configuration). If you are using the framework for the purpose of wireframing and prototyping and this is your first time, read over [Designing with the Framework](/foundation/for-designers/design-with-the-framework). If you are contributing to the framework, squashing bugs, or developing new components of your own [Developing with the Framework](developing-with-the-framework) is where you'll want to start.
