# Typography

## Highlights

*   Strip user-agent styling from all standard text elements. Reset to base size and style.
*   Establish specific styles of text (font, size, color, spacing) and create CSS classes to apply.
*   Seperation of concerns between design and SEO.

## Roadmap

*   Continuous research in effective display and use of type.
*   SVG alternative to bullets.

## Text Elements

### Typography Styles

We begin by resetting all font sizes, weights, & margins for text elements. We then build classes to apply styling to these elements individually. This allows us the freedom to use the heading elements in any way we like, without compromising our choosen formatting. We have the freedom to use the tags for their SEO and semantic benefit and our classes for their styling and presentation.

TBD.

Next we define some text based classes that serve as a starting point for any future styling. This includes things like headers, titles, sub-titles, and normal paragraph text.

We use **rems** as the unit of measure, so that font sizes are proportionate to the font-size assigned to the HTML tag. Our deafult base is 16px. We can change this, for instance, between breakpoints to automatically scale the font size accordingly. Sizes are based on an [augmented 4th scale](http://type-scale.com/?size=16&scale=1.414&text=A%20Visual%20Type%20Scale&webfont=Libre+Baskerville&font-family=%27Libre%20Baskerville%27,%20serif&font-weight=400&font-family-headers=&font-weight-headers=inherit&background-color=white&font-color=%23333).

TBD.

### Lists

Ordered and unordered Lists will follow the same sizing parameters as our basic paragraph text. Bullets appear on the outside, so lines that wrap are nicely aligned to the left.

TBD.

Unordered List (1 rem)
